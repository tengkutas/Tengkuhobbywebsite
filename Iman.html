        <h2>WILL YOU LOVE ME?</h2>
		  <p> Struggling to fit in all her life, Nieza, a cardiologist, decided that it was time for her to move back home to Malaysia. With one of her best friends leaving and the other busy with oncologist training, she felt that there was nothing left for her in Liverpool. Then, a man from her past unexpectedly appeared and stirred up new, unfamiliar emotions within her. He awakened a feeling she never knew existed. As fate threw them in each other's path, they found out that they share similar struggles – isolation and loneliness. However, they soon realised that while a life designed by God is beautiful, it is not without obstacles. Just as Nieza began to feel like she belonged, her faith was put to the test. Will she be able to weather the storm and open herself up to love again?</p>

        <h1>REVIEW</h1>
        <p>This book is a nice, easy read with some important messages. While some readers expected more romance between Nieza and Harris, I found that the book’s real focus is on the friendship between Nieza, Amy, and Hassan. Their friendship is the best part of the story, showing what it means to have true friends who understand and support each other.One of the best novel by Norhafsah. </p>
